# How to Spread, Adapt, and Improve This Manual

This manual is not finished. It's not supposed to be.

**This is a living document**—designed to be tested in the field, improved by practitioners, adapted for different contexts, and translated into languages and cultures we can't anticipate.

Your job is not just to use it. Your job is to **make it better**.

This section explains:
- How to contribute improvements
- How to adapt it for your region/context
- How to translate it
- How to spread it
- What we will and won't accept as contributions

## What We Actively Want

### 1. Regional Case Studies

**Format:** Use the template in `templates/case-study-template.md`

**Especially interested in:**
- Non-US contexts (Latin America, Europe, Africa, Asia)
- Rural organizing (we're currently US-urban heavy)
- Indigenous-led movements
- Global South campaigns
- Red states / conservative-leaning areas

**What to include:**
- Context (place, time, issue)
- Mapping to the 7-step protocol (what worked, what didn't)
- Key takeaways
- Outcome (win/loss/ongoing)

### 2. Policy Reframes

**Format:** Use the template in `templates/policy-reframe-template.md`

**We need more reframes for:**
- Municipal/local policies (not just state/federal)
- Non-US contexts (your country's healthcare/housing/labor issues)
- Policies we missed (childcare, elder care, disability justice, etc.)

**What to include:**
- Standard Green pitch
- Integral multi-stage reframe (Blue/Orange/Red)
- Common objections and killer responses

### 3. Failure Autopsies

**Format:** Use the template in `templates/failure-autopsy-template.md`

**Why failures matter:**
We learn more from losses than wins. If your campaign failed, document why. Where did you skip steps? What would you do differently?

**What to include:**
- What you tried
- Why it failed (map to the 7 steps)
- What you'd do differently
- Lessons for others

### 4. Translations

**Languages we need:**
- Spanish (Latin American and European dialects)
- French
- Portuguese (Brazilian)
- Arabic
- Mandarin
- Hindi
- And any other language where organizing is happening

**How to translate:**
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a new folder: `translations/[language-code]/`
3. Translate the markdown files
4. Submit a PR
5. You'll be credited as translator and linked to your preferred platform

**Translation guidelines:**
- Don't just translate words—translate concepts for cultural context
- Use the Regional Adaptation Template (see below) to identify what needs cultural adjustment
- Keep formatting (headers, lists, tables) intact

### 5. Improved Examples, Clearer Language, Better Exercises

**If you:**
- Found a section confusing
- Tried an exercise that didn't work
- Have a better example than what's in the manual
- Can simplify dense language

**Please submit improvements!** We want this to be as clear and usable as possible.

---

## What We Will Not Accept

To maintain coherence and quality, we will reject contributions that:

### ❌ Increase Complexity Without Adding Value
- Academic jargon that doesn't improve clarity
- Theoretical additions without practical application
- Sections that make the manual harder to use

### ❌ Undermine the Core Framework
- Suggestions that skip or reorder the 7-step sequence without strong evidence
- Additions that contradict the integral approach (e.g., "just do Green messaging harder")
- Claims that aren't backed by evidence or field experience

### ❌ Violate the "Do No Harm" Principle
- Contributions that encourage unsafe organizing practices
- Suggestions to open grief portals without proper containers
- Tactics that would predictably lead to retraumatization

### ❌ Are Purely Self-Promotional
- "Use my coaching services" plugs
- Links to paid courses without clear value to the manual
- Contributions that center the contributor more than the work

**Note:** If your contribution is rejected, we'll explain why in the PR discussion. You're welcome to revise and resubmit.

## Regional Adaptation Template

**Use this template when adapting the manual for your context.**

Save as: `adaptations/[region-name]-adaptation.md` and submit as a PR.

### Template

```markdown
# Regional Adaptation: [Country/Region Name]

**Adapted by:** [Your Name]  
**Date:** [Date]  
**Version:** Based on v2.2 of the Field Manual

---

## Context Differences

### 1. Dominant Developmental Stage in This Region
- [ ] Mostly Blue (Traditional/Religious)
- [ ] Mostly Orange (Achievement/Pragmatic)
- [ ] Mixed Blue/Orange
- [ ] Significant Green presence
- [ ] Other (describe):

**What this means for organizing:**
[Explain how this changes messaging, tactics, policy framing]

---

### 2. Local "Trusted Swimmer" Archetypes

**In the US manual, trusted swimmers are:** Veterans, nurses, teachers, union members

**In [Your Region], trusted swimmers are:**
- [Profession/Role 1]
- [Profession/Role 2]
- [Profession/Role 3]

**Why these roles have credibility here:**
[Explain the cultural context]

---

### 3. Primary Extractive Forces

**In the US manual, the enemies are:** Private equity, insurance companies, fossil fuel companies

**In [Your Region], the primary extractive forces are:**
- [Force 1: e.g., Land developers, corrupt officials, multinational mining companies]
- [Force 2]
- [Force 3]

**How this changes the framing:**
[Explain how to name these enemies effectively]

---

### 4. Policies That Need Full Cultural Rewrite

**These policies from Section 7 don't translate directly:**

| US Policy | Why It Doesn't Work Here | Local Alternative |
|-----------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Example: Federal Job Guarantee | We don't have a functioning federal government | Municipal employment programs through local councils |

---

### 5. Case Studies from This Region

**Add 1-3 case studies relevant to your region using the case study template.**

---

### 6. Anti-Patterns Specific to This Region

**Are there organizing mistakes common in your region that aren't in Section 9?**

Example: "In [Country], movements often collapse due to [specific local issue: ethnic tensions, government infiltration, religious sectarianism, etc.]"

[Describe the pattern and the fix]

---

### 7. Language and Framing Adjustments

**Words/phrases that don't work in this context:**

| US Term | Why It Fails Here | Better Local Term |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| "Organizing" | Sounds like communism | "Community mobilization" or "Civic action" |

## The Spreadsheet Strategy

Finally, a meta-note on distribution:

**This manual is designed to spread organically through trust networks, not through marketing campaigns.**

The best way to spread it:
1. Use it in your organizing work
2. Win something because of it
3. Tell the story of what worked
4. Share the manual with people who ask "how did you do that?"

**If 100 organizers use this and each wins one campaign, and each of those campaigns inspires 10 more organizers...**

That's not exponential growth. That's **demonstrated proof** spreading through the most trusted channel: peer-to-peer storytelling from people who've actually won.

**We're not trying to go viral. We're trying to build a knowledge commons that makes movements more effective.**

If this manual helps you win, it's done its job.

If you improve it for the next person, you've done yours.

---

## Final Note: This Is a Gift, Not a Product

This manual is not for sale (though you can sell physical copies you print).  
There are no premium tiers, no paywalls, no consulting upsells.

**It's a gift to the ecosystem.**

The only ask: If it helps you, help the next person. Contribute what you learn. Share what works. Document what fails.

**We are building the knowledge infrastructure for the movements that will transform the world.**

That work belongs to all of us.

Let's build it together.

## Navigation by Timeframe

**You have 1 hour:**  
→ Read **0. Pre-Flight Checklist** + **6.1 Stop the Bleeding**

**You have 1 day:**  
→ Add **7. Policy Playbook** + one case study from **Section 8** that matches your context

**You have 1 week:**  
→ Read the whole thing, but start with your role-specific path above

**You're facilitating a group study (4-6 weeks):**  
→ Use the "Facilitator's Guide" sidebars in each section (they include discussion questions, time estimates, and exercises)

## A Note on Reading Order

**The manual is designed to be read in sequence** (Sections 0→1→2→3→4→5→6→7→8→9→10), because each section builds on the previous one. But we also know you're busy and might need specific tools right now.

If you jump directly to a tactical section, **make sure you've at least read the Pre-Flight Checklist**. It will save you from common mistakes that can't be fixed later.

## What This Manual Is Not

This is not:
- A persuasive essay about why progressive policies are good (we assume you already believe that)
- A feel-good guide to "healing spaces" and "self-care" (though we address trauma, we do so strategically)
- A detailed legislative how-to (for that, see *Indivisible Guide* or *Movement Politics*)
- A substitute for organizing experience (theory without practice is useless)

This is:
- A **diagnostic framework** for understanding why your morally superior policy keeps losing
- A **non-negotiable sequence** for building power in traumatized communities
- A **collection of field-tested tactics** for winning material battles, not moral arguments

**Now go where you need to go. The work is waiting.**

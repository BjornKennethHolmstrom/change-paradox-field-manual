# The Integral Policy Playbook

This is where theory becomes toolkit.

You've learned the diagnostic lenses. You've trained in healthy Red energy. You've internalized the 7-step sequence. **Now you need actual policy language that works.**

This section provides **15 concrete policy reframes** across multiple domains—healthcare, housing, labor, climate, education, and more. Each one is designed to:

1. **Honor Blue values** (duty, tradition, community, stewardship)
2. **Honor Orange values** (achievement, efficiency, innovation, opportunity)
3. **Channel healthy Red energy** (protection, strength, clear enemies)
4. **Achieve Green/Yellow outcomes** (justice, sustainability, systemic transformation)

**This is what "transcend and include" actually looks like in practice.**

Use these as templates. Adapt them to your local context. Test them in the field. Improve them. Then submit your improvements back to the repo.

## How to Use This Playbook

Each policy is presented in a three-column format:

| **Domain** | **Standard Green Pitch** | **Integral Multi-Stage Reframe** | **Common Objections & Killer Responses** |
|------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|

**Column 1:** The typical progressive framing (usually pure Green)  
**Column 2:** The reframed version that speaks to Blue/Orange/Red  
**Column 3:** The most common objections you'll hear, with responses that disarm them

**Your job:** Read these. Practice them. Adapt them. Make them your own.

## Healthcare

### Policy 1: Universal Healthcare

| **Standard Green Pitch** | **Integral Multi-Stage Reframe** | **Common Objections & Killer Responses** |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| "Healthcare is a human right. We need Medicare for All to end the injustice of for-profit medicine" | **Blue:** "Every American who works hard and serves their community deserves the dignity of knowing they'll be cared for when they're sick. It's our duty as a nation to protect our own." <br><br>**Orange:** "We're the only developed nation bleeding $500 billion annually to insurance middlemen who add zero value. Single-payer is the efficient, competitive solution that frees businesses from healthcare costs and lets them focus on innovation." <br><br>**Red:** "Your family will never go bankrupt from medical bills again. We will end the insurance companies' stranglehold on your life. They've been extracting from you for decades—we're taking that power back." | **"That's socialism!"** <br>→ "It's the same system that covers every veteran, every senior on Medicare, and every member of Congress. If it's good enough for them, it's good enough for you." <br><br>**"We can't afford it!"** <br>→ "We're already paying for it—we're just paying twice as much through the most inefficient system on Earth. This saves money." <br><br>**"I don't want government-run healthcare!"** <br>→ "Your insurance company already denies your claims and rations your care. At least with Medicare, you can vote out the people in charge." |

### Policy 2: Community Health Cooperatives (Alternative Model)

| **Standard Green Pitch** | **Integral Multi-Stage Reframe** | **Common Objections & Killer Responses** |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| "We need universal healthcare through expanded government programs" | **Blue:** "Health coverage through member-owned cooperatives—like credit unions for medicine. Your community takes care of its own." <br><br>**Orange:** "Competing nonprofit health co-ops, chartered like credit unions. You choose which one to join. They compete for members on quality and cost, but there's no profit extraction. Think of it as capitalism without the vampires." <br><br>**Red:** "No corporate middlemen. No Wall Street shareholders. Just you, your neighbors, and your doctors. Local control. Local power." | **"How is this different from Obamacare?"** <br>→ "Obamacare still routes money through for-profit insurance companies. This cuts them out entirely—you own the co-op, like you own a credit union." <br><br>**"Will my doctor still accept it?"** <br>→ "Co-ops pay doctors directly, usually better than insurance companies do. Doctors love this model." |

---

## Housing

### Policy 3: Social Housing / Public Housing 2.0

| **Standard Green Pitch** | **Integral Multi-Stage Reframe** | **Common Objections & Killer Responses** |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| "Housing is a human right. We need to decommodify housing and stop landlord exploitation" | **Blue:** "Every family that works hard should be able to afford a stable home in a safe neighborhood. Strong families need strong foundations—and that starts with secure housing." <br><br>**Orange:** "Vienna's public housing model: 60% of residents live in beautiful, well-maintained, city-owned apartments. It stabilizes the entire housing market and keeps rents low for everyone—including private renters. It's smart economic policy." <br><br>**Red:** "We're going to stop Wall Street from buying up every house in your neighborhood and turning you into a permanent renter. Your home should be *yours*, not an asset in some hedge fund's portfolio." | **"Public housing is slums!"** <br>→ "Only in the US, because we deliberately underfunded it. In Vienna, Singapore, and Copenhagen, public housing is beautiful, mixed-income, and desirable. We can build it right." <br><br>**"The government can't build anything!"** <br>→ "The government built the interstate highway system, sent humans to the moon, and created the internet. We can build apartments." <br><br>**"This will tank property values!"** <br>→ "It stabilizes property values by preventing speculative bubbles. Homeowners in Vienna have stable, predictable markets—not boom-bust cycles." |

### Policy 4: Community Land Trusts

| **Standard Green Pitch** | **Integral Multi-Stage Reframe** | **Common Objections & Killer Responses** |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| "We need to remove housing from the speculative market" | **Blue:** "Community-owned land, passed down through generations. Your grandkids will be able to afford to live in the same town you built." <br><br>**Orange:** "You own your house. The community owns the land under it. You can sell your house, but only for a fair price—no speculation. It's ownership without the casino." <br><br>**Red:** "We're taking the land back from developers and holding it in trust for the people who actually live here. Outsiders can't come in and price you out anymore." | **"I won't be able to sell my house for profit!"** <br>→ "You'll be able to sell it for what you paid plus inflation and the value of improvements you made. What you lose in speculative gains, you gain in stability—your kids can still afford to live here." <br><br>**"This limits my freedom!"** <br>→ "It limits the freedom of Wall Street to turn your neighborhood into an investment vehicle. It expands your freedom to stay in the place you built." |

---

## Labor & Economy

### Policy 5: Federal Job Guarantee

| **Standard Green Pitch** | **Integral Multi-Stage Reframe** | **Common Objections & Killer Responses** |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| "We need a federal jobs program to guarantee employment for everyone" | **Blue:** "The National Resilience & Service Corps: dignified work for anyone willing to serve their community. You contribute, you get paid a living wage and health benefits. It's duty, service, and security." <br><br>**Orange:** "Eliminates unemployment permanently, stabilizes the economy during recessions, and creates a skilled workforce for infrastructure, climate adaptation, and elder care. It's the ultimate economic shock absorber." <br><br>**Red:** "No one gets left behind. You want to work? There's a job. You want to provide for your family? We guarantee it. The oligarchs can't threaten you with starvation anymore—you've got options." | **"This is make-work!"** <br>→ "Fixing crumbling bridges, retrofitting buildings for climate, caring for elders, planting trees—that's not make-work, that's work we desperately need done." <br><br>**"People will just freeload!"** <br>→ "It requires work. You show up, you do the job, you get paid. It's not UBI—it's a job." <br><br>**"This will cause inflation!"** <br>→ "It's countercyclical. During booms, people leave for private sector jobs. During busts, it prevents economic collapse. It stabilizes prices, not inflates them." |

### Policy 6: Worker Ownership & Co-op Expansion

| **Standard Green Pitch** | **Integral Multi-Stage Reframe** | **Common Objections & Killer Responses** |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| "We need to democratize the workplace and give workers control over production" | **Blue:** "When you own part of the company you work for, you're not just an employee—you're a steward. You're building something you can pass down to your kids." <br><br>**Orange:** "Worker-owned companies are more productive, more innovative, and more resilient than traditional corporations. Mondragon in Spain: 80,000 worker-owners, $12 billion in revenue, survived the 2008 crash with almost no layoffs. That's smart business." <br><br>**Red:** "You built the company with your sweat and labor. Why should some Wall Street investor who's never set foot in the building take most of the profit? Take back what's yours." | **"Workers don't have the skills to run companies!"** <br>→ "They already do. Who do you think actually makes the products and serves the customers? We're just saying they should share in the decisions and the profits." <br><br>**"This will destroy innovation!"** <br>→ "Worker co-ops invent, adapt, and compete. They just distribute the gains more fairly. Nothing about shared ownership kills innovation—it often strengthens it." |

### Policy 7: Maximum Wage / Wealth Cap

| **Standard Green Pitch** | **Integral Multi-Stage Reframe** | **Common Objections & Killer Responses** |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| "We need to cap CEO pay and eliminate billionaires through wealth taxes" | **Blue:** "No one person should make 500 times what their workers make. That's not merit—that's greed. We used to have an understanding: the CEO makes 20-30x the average worker. Let's return to that." <br><br>**Orange:** "Extreme wealth concentration is economically inefficient. A dollar in the hands of a working person generates more economic activity than a dollar in a billionaire's offshore account. This is about growth, not punishment." <br><br>**Red:** "They didn't earn a billion dollars. They extracted it. We're taking it back and using it to build infrastructure, schools, and hospitals. They'll survive on $999 million." | **"This punishes success!"** <br>→ "It punishes extraction. If you invent something, you get rich. If you exploit workers and offshore profits, we claw it back." <br><br>**"The rich will just leave!"** <br>→ "Good luck running your American business from the Cayman Islands. We'll tax wealth based on citizenship and where the value was created. You want access to US markets? Pay up." <br><br>**"This is un-American!"** <br>→ "We had a 90% top marginal tax rate under Eisenhower. The postwar boom happened under high taxes on the rich. This *is* the American tradition." |

## Climate & Energy

### Policy 8: Community-Owned Renewable Energy

| **Standard Green Pitch** | **Integral Multi-Stage Reframe** | **Common Objections & Killer Responses** |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| "We need a Green New Deal to transition to renewable energy and fight climate injustice" | **Blue:** "We have a sacred duty to be good stewards of the land for our children and grandchildren. Community-owned solar and wind means we control our energy future—not foreign oil or Wall Street." <br><br>**Orange:** "Energy independence through local renewable co-ops. Cut your electric bill by 40%, create local jobs, and beat the utility companies at their own game. It's the smart play." <br><br>**Red:** "We're going to break the stranglehold of energy monopolies. Your community will own the grid. They can't price-gouge you anymore. And we'll crush OPEC in the process." | **"Renewables are unreliable!"** <br>→ "Modern battery storage and smart grids solve that. Texas's grid failed during the freeze because it was mismanaged and isolated—not because wind turbines don't work." <br><br>**"This will kill jobs!"** <br>→ "Solar installation, wind turbine maintenance, and grid modernization create more jobs per dollar than fossil fuels. We're offering those displaced workers first priority for the new jobs—same pay, union protection." <br><br>**"We can't afford it!"** <br>→ "We can't afford not to. Every year we delay costs us billions in climate disasters. This is an investment that pays for itself." |

### Policy 9: Fossil Fuel Worker Transition with Dignity

| **Standard Green Pitch** | **Integral Multi-Stage Reframe** | **Common Objections & Killer Responses** |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| "We need a just transition away from fossil fuels" | **Blue:** "The coal miners and oil workers who powered America for 100 years deserve honor, retirement security, and first priority for the jobs of the future. We don't abandon the people who built this country." <br><br>**Orange:** "Retrain and redeploy the most skilled industrial workforce on the planet. These are the people who built refineries and power plants—they can build the new energy infrastructure. It's smart resource allocation." <br><br>**Red:** "You gave your health, your back, and your lungs to power this nation. We will not throw you away. Union job, same pay, full benefits, pension protected. You've earned it." | **"You just want to destroy our way of life!"** <br>→ "We want to honor your past and secure your future. The fossil fuel companies that got rich off your labor are abandoning you. We're not." <br><br>**"Renewable jobs don't pay as much!"** <br>→ "They will when they're union jobs with the same contracts. We're guaranteeing it." |

## Education

### Policy 10: Universal Pre-K & Free College

| **Standard Green Pitch** | **Integral Multi-Stage Reframe** | **Common Objections & Killer Responses** |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| "Education is a human right. We need free college and universal pre-K" | **Blue:** "Every child deserves a strong start, and every young person willing to work hard should be able to get an education without drowning in debt. It's an investment in our future." <br><br>**Orange:** "Countries with free college have more skilled workforces, higher productivity, and faster innovation. This isn't charity—it's competitive advantage. Plus, universal pre-K gives parents the childcare they need to work." <br><br>**Red:** "Your kid shouldn't graduate with $100,000 in debt because some banker wanted a return on investment. We're eliminating the debt and making college free. The loan sharks lose. You win." | **"I paid for my education—why shouldn't they?"** <br>→ "You paid 1/10th what they're being charged now. Tuition has increased 1,200% while wages stagnated. The game is rigged. Let's un-rig it." <br><br>**"Not everyone should go to college!"** <br>→ "Correct. That's why we're also funding trade schools, apprenticeships, and vocational training. Every path to a good career should be affordable." <br><br>**"This devalues degrees!"** <br>→ "Degrees are already devalued by credential inflation. What we're doing is making education accessible so talent can rise regardless of family wealth." |

### Policy 11: Trade Schools & Apprenticeship Expansion

| **Standard Green Pitch** | **Integral Multi-Stage Reframe** | **Common Objections & Killer Responses** |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| "We need to fund vocational training" | **Blue:** "Not everyone is meant for college, and that's good. We need skilled tradespeople—electricians, welders, carpenters. These are honorable, essential professions that built America." <br><br>**Orange:** "Apprenticeships are earn-while-you-learn. No debt, immediate income, and high demand. Plumbers make more than many lawyers. This is the smart path for millions of people." <br><br>**Red:** "The white-collar elite told you college was the only way. They lied. We're going to fund the trades, pay you to learn, and put you in a union job making $80k+ with benefits. They can keep their student debt." | **"Trades are looked down on!"** <br>→ "Only by people who've never had to fix their own sink. We're going to elevate the trades to the status they deserve—and pay them what they're worth." |

---

## Immigration

### Policy 12: Pathway to Citizenship + Worker Protections

| **Standard Green Pitch** | **Integral Multi-Stage Reframe** | **Common Objections & Killer Responses** |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| "We need comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship" | **Blue:** "People who work hard, pay taxes, and contribute to the community should have a path to become full members. That's how America has always worked." <br><br>**Orange:** "Undocumented workers are already here, already working. Legalizing them brings them into the tax system, raises wages for everyone (because employers can't undercut with illegal labor), and grows the economy." <br><br>**Red:** "Corporations exploit undocumented workers to drive down wages for everyone. We're going to legalize the workers and crack down on the bosses who exploit them. United, we're stronger. Divided, we all lose." | **"They're taking our jobs!"** <br>→ "Corporations are taking your jobs and blaming immigrants. Who outsourced your factory to China? Not the guy picking strawberries. Let's fight the real enemy." <br><br>**"They don't pay taxes!"** <br>→ "Most do—through sales tax, property tax (via rent), and payroll tax (using fake SSNs). They pay in and get nothing back. Let's formalize it so everyone contributes fairly." <br><br>**"We need to secure the border first!"** <br>→ "We've spent $350 billion on border enforcement in 20 years. It doesn't work because the demand is driven by economics. Fix the economic exploitation and you fix the root cause." |

---

## Democracy & Governance

### Policy 13: Ranked-Choice Voting & Proportional Representation

| **Standard Green Pitch** | **Integral Multi-Stage Reframe** | **Common Objections & Killer Responses** |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| "We need electoral reform to make democracy more representative" | **Blue:** "Every vote should count. Right now, if you live in a 'safe' district, your vote doesn't matter. This gives everyone a voice." <br><br>**Orange:** "Ranked-choice voting eliminates 'spoiler' candidates and reduces negative campaigning. It's more efficient and gives you more choice. It's how businesses elect boards—it works." <br><br>**Red:** "The two-party system is rigged to keep outsiders out. This breaks their stranglehold. If 30% of people want a different option, they should get representation." | **"It's too complicated!"** <br>→ "You rank your preferences 1-2-3. If your first choice loses, your vote goes to your second choice. It's simpler than filing taxes." <br><br>**"This helps third parties!"** <br>→ "Yes. That's the point. Competition is good. Monopolies are bad." |

### Policy 14: Public Campaign Financing

| **Standard Green Pitch** | **Integral Multi-Stage Reframe** | **Common Objections & Killer Responses** |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| "We need to get money out of politics" | **Blue:** "Public servants should serve the public, not their donors. Politicians should spend their time listening to constituents, not dialing for dollars from billionaires." <br><br>**Orange:** "Small donors + public matching funds = politicians who respond to voters, not lobbyists. It's a better market—more competition, more accountability." <br><br>**Red:** "Right now, your representative works for Pfizer, Goldman Sachs, and Lockheed Martin. We're going to make them work for you. Cut the leash. Fire the puppet masters." | **"This is my tax dollars funding campaigns!"** <br>→ "You're already funding campaigns—through corporate subsidies and tax breaks for donors. This way is cheaper and you get actual representation." <br><br>**"Free speech!"** <br>→ "Money isn't speech. Money is a megaphone. And right now, billionaires have megaphones and you have a whisper. This levels the playing field." |

---

## Criminal Justice

### Policy 15: Abolish Cash Bail + Restorative Justice

| **Standard Green Pitch** | **Integral Multi-Stage Reframe** | **Common Objections & Killer Responses** |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| "We need to end mass incarceration and implement restorative justice" | **Blue:** "If someone is dangerous, they stay locked up. If they're not dangerous, they shouldn't be punished for being poor. Cash bail means rich people go free and poor people sit in jail for the same crime. That's not justice—that's corruption." <br><br>**Orange:** "Pretrial detention costs taxpayers $14 billion a year. Risk assessment algorithms are cheaper and more accurate than cash bail. This saves money and is more effective." <br><br>**Red:** "The bail bond industry is a predatory scam extracting money from poor people. We're shutting it down. If you're not a threat, you stay with your family. If you are a threat, no amount of money gets you out." | **"Criminals will just flee!"** <br>→ "Most don't. Data from jurisdictions that eliminated cash bail shows up to 95% of people return for court. Turns out, most people aren't flight risks." <br><br>**"What about violent criminals?"** <br>→ "If someone is actually dangerous, they stay in custody—no bail at all. Cash bail doesn't keep dangerous people locked up—it just punishes poor people who can't pay." |

## How to Adapt These for Your Context

**Step 1: Test the reframe with your audience**
- Say it out loud to 5-10 people from the community you're trying to reach
- Ask: "Does this resonate? What language feels off?"
- Adjust based on feedback

**Step 2: Add local specifics**
- Name local villains (which corporation? which landlord? which policy-maker?)
- Reference local wins or local crises
- Ground it in tangible, immediate reality

**Step 3: Practice until it feels natural**
- The first time you try a Blue or Orange reframe, it might feel awkward
- That's normal. Keep practicing.
- Eventually, code-switching across stages will become second nature

**Step 4: Share your improvements**
- Submit new reframes or better language to the GitHub repo
- Help build the collective toolkit

## Facilitator's Guide

**Time:** 90-120 minutes

**Materials:** Printed policy reframes, whiteboards, role-play scenarios

**Structure:**
1. **(20 min)** Lecture: Why reframing matters—same policy, different language
2. **(30 min)** Practice: Pick 3 policies most relevant to your context. Practice delivering all three reframes (Blue, Orange, Red).
3. **(30 min)** Role-play: Half the group plays skeptical voters from different stages. Other half practices responding to objections.
4. **(10 min)** Debrief: Which reframes felt most natural? Which felt forced?

**Discussion Questions:**
- Which value system (Blue/Orange/Red) is hardest for you to speak to authentically?
- Have you ever been in a conversation where the right reframe would have made the difference?
- What local policy fight could benefit from these reframes?

---

## Final Note: This Is Not Manipulation

Some people will accuse you of "pandering" or "manipulating" people by speaking to their values.

**That's not what this is.**

Manipulation is lying about your goals to get what you want. **Reframing is telling the truth in a language people can hear.**

- Universal healthcare **does** honor the value of duty and stewardship (Blue)
- Worker ownership **is** more efficient and innovative (Orange)
- Community land trusts **do** protect people from extraction (Red)

**We're not changing the policy. We're changing the packaging so people can actually receive it.**

That's not manipulation. That's communication.

Now let's look at how these policies have worked (or failed) in practice. Turn to Section 8: Deep-Dive Case Studies.

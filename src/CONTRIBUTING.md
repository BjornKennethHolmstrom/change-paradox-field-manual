## Code of Conduct

This manual is built on the principle that **movements require brave spaces, not just safe spaces**. We will:

✅ **Challenge each other constructively**  
✅ **Assume good faith**  
✅ **Focus on what works in the field, not what sounds good in theory**  
✅ **Prioritize practical utility over ideological purity**

We will not tolerate:
❌ Personal attacks or harassment  
❌ Bigotry of any kind  
❌ Bad faith arguments or trolling  
❌ Self-promotion without value-add

If you're not sure whether your contribution fits, open an issue first and ask!

## What We Want

### 1. 🌍 Regional Case Studies

**Especially needed:**
- Non-US contexts (Latin America, Europe, Africa, Asia)
- Rural organizing
- Indigenous-led movements
- Red states / conservative areas
- Global South campaigns

**Use the template:** `templates/case-study-template.md`

### 2. 📋 Policy Reframes

**Especially needed:**
- Municipal/local policies
- Non-US contexts
- Policies we missed (childcare, elder care, disability justice)

**Use the template:** `templates/policy-reframe-template.md`

### 3. 💥 Failure Autopsies

We learn more from losses than wins. If your campaign failed, help others learn from it.

**Use the template:** `templates/failure-autopsy-template.md`

### 4. 🌐 Translations

**Priority languages:**
- Spanish (both Latin American and European)
- French
- Portuguese (Brazilian)
- Arabic
- Mandarin
- Hindi

**Translation guidelines:**
1. Fork the repo
2. Create folder: `translations/[language-code]/`
3. Translate the markdown files
4. Use the Regional Adaptation Template to note cultural changes needed
5. Submit PR

### 5. ✏️ Improvements to Existing Content

**We want:**
- Clearer examples
- Simpler language
- Better exercises
- Corrections of errors
- Updates based on new information

## What We Don't Want

### ❌ Complexity Without Value

- Academic jargon that doesn't improve clarity
- Theoretical additions without practical application
- Anything that makes the manual harder to use

### ❌ Undermining the Core Framework

- Skipping or reordering the 7-step sequence without strong evidence
- "Just do Green messaging harder" suggestions
- Claims without evidence or field experience

### ❌ Unsafe Practices

- Encouraging trauma work without proper containers
- Tactics that predictably lead to harm
- Advice that violates "Do No Harm" principles

### ❌ Self-Promotion

- "Use my coaching services" plugs
- Links to paid courses without clear value
- Contributions that center you more than the work

**Note:** If we reject your contribution, we'll explain why in the PR. You're welcome to revise and resubmit.

## Contribution Process

### 1. Small Changes (typos, clarifications, minor improvements)

Just submit a PR directly. No need to open an issue first.

### 2. Medium Changes (new examples, expanded sections)

Open an issue first describing what you want to add. Wait for feedback, then submit PR.

### 3. Large Changes (new sections, major restructuring)

**Always open an issue first.** Large changes need discussion before implementation.

### Review Timeline

- Small changes: Reviewed within 1 week
- Medium changes: Reviewed within 2 weeks
- Large changes: May take 3-4 weeks for thorough review

## Style Guidelines

### Voice and Tone

- **Direct and practical**, not academic
- **No hedging or apologizing** ("This might work" → "This works when...")
- **Active voice** ("We build power" not "Power is built")
- **Specific examples** over abstract theory
- **Field-tested** language (if you haven't tried it, say so)

### Formatting

- Use **markdown headers** consistently (# for sections, ## for subsections)
- **Bold** for emphasis, *italics* for voice/internal dialogue
- Use `code blocks` for specific phrases or terms to memorize
- Tables for comparisons
- Bullet points for lists (but not excessively—see Section 1)

### Length

- **Case studies:** 1,500-3,000 words
- **Policy reframes:** 300-500 words per policy
- **Failure autopsies:** 1,000-2,000 words
- **Anti-patterns:** 800-1,200 words

### Citations and Sources

- **Link to sources** when making factual claims
- **Name the campaign/organization** when referencing real examples
- **Credit other organizers and theorists** whose work you're building on
- If you learned it from someone, attribute them

## Templates

All templates are in the `templates/` folder:

- `case-study-template.md` — For documenting campaigns
- `policy-reframe-template.md` — For adding new policy reframes
- `failure-autopsy-template.md` — For documenting losses
- `regional-adaptation-template.md` — For adapting the manual to your context

**Use these templates!** They ensure consistency and make review faster.

---

## Testing Your Contribution

Before submitting:

1. **Read it out loud** — Does it sound natural or academic?
2. **Show it to an organizer** — Not an academic. Someone doing the work.
3. **Check for jargon** — Could a high school graduate understand this?
4. **Verify links** — Do all your links work?
